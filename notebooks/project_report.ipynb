    "ChemCluster is a streamlined and interactive platform designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of chemical datasets using molecular clustering techniques. It leverages the power of **RDKit** for cheminformatics and **Streamlit** for web interface deployment, offering an intuitive solution for researchers and students alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main modes of operation are supported by the platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Mode**: This mode allows users to upload datasets (in `.sdf`, `.mol` or `.csv` format) containing multiple molecular structures.  The molecules are processed to compute their key physicochemical descriptors, then clustered based on these properties. The resulting clusters are visualized interactively, and users can explore individual structures along with their 2D/3D representations and calculated properties.\n",
    "- **Single Molecule Mode**: In this workflow, ChemCluster generates a set of conformers for a single input molecule. These conformers are clustered based on structural similarity, and representative structures are visualized in  3D, enabling users to analyze conformational diversity effectively.\n"

    "## 7. Challenges Faced\n",
    "While the development of ChemCluster was overall successful and rewarding, some challenges we faced are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High dimensionality of molecular space:**  \n",
    "  Molecular fingerprints are often thousands of dimensions. Therefore, effective clustering relies on robust dimensionality reduction techniques. Naturally, important variance can still be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Molecular representation bottlenecks:**  \n",
    "  Traditional Morgan fingerprints may fail to capture finer details, such as complex electronic or stereochemical subtleties. This also impacts quality of the clustering.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Performance bottlenecks:**  \n",
    "  When processing more than 1000 molecules or generating large numbers of 3D conformers, the application experienced noticeable slowdowns. This could be mainly due to the computational cost of fingerprint comparison, distance matrix construction, and 3D optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Errors in SMILES parsing:**  \n",
    "  Molecules may pass the initial SMILES validity check, but fail at 3D embedding. As a consquence, there were occasionally incorrect or unexpected geometries, especially for stereochemically rich or flexible molecules. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-platform compatibility and Streamlit limitations:**  \n",
    "  The app’s frontend, built with Streamlit, showed slight differences between platforms (notably Windows vs. macOS), such as font rendering and responsiveness. Some third-party components like `streamlit_plotly_events` or `py3Dmol` also required version-specific fixes or careful dependency management.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues were mitigated through automatic molecule cleaning, limitation of dataset size, and standardization of 3D visualization settings. While not fully resolved, they are documented and provide a clear direction for future improvements.\n",
    "\n"

    "## 8. Conclusion and Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of ChemCluster provided valuable insights into the challenges and potential of combining cheminformatics tools with unsupervised machine learning techniques. The application has successfully enabled both conformer-based and fingerprint-based molecular clustering, while also offering interactive visualization and analysis via a Streamlit interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, there still remains areas of improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improving molecular representations:**  \n",
    "  A promising direction would be to use learned molecular embeddings, such as those generated from transformer-based models like ChemBERTa; the latter encodes richer chemical context by leveraging large-scale molecular data during pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore alternative clustering algorithms:**  \n",
    " Instead of using KMeans, different unsupervised clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN or Agglomerative clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore alternative similarity metrics:**  \n",
    " Conformer clustering currently relies on RMSD, which measures geometrical alignment but not energetic or functional similarity. Therefore, it would be interesting to use metrics based on conformer energy differences, shape overlap and pharmacophoric feature. This would offer more chemically meaningful clustering, particularly in the context of bioactive conformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investigation of hydrogen bonding interactions:**  \n",
    "Extending the current pipeline to identify and visualize H-bonding networks between conformer centroids in solution could reveal solvation effects. Thus, this could be especially valuable for applications involving transition state sampling (e.g. in computational chemistry), where conformer bias can greatly affect kinetic predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, addressing these new directions, ChemCluster could evolve into a more robust platform for both molecular clustering and conformational analysis. "
